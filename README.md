# unit-4-game

## Introduction

This is a RPG like Star Wars game created with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. Users can select a character to attack enemy characters. When all enemy characters are defeated the user has won the game.

## How It Works

Users begin the game by selecting a character to attack with. Each character has different Health Points (HP) and Attack Power (AP). The remaining characters then become enemy characters and the user must select which enemy to fight first. Once an enemy character is selected to fight, the user can click the "Attack" button. Each time the "Attack" button is clicked the user character and enemy character each deal damage equal to their AP, and their HP is updated to reflect their remaining HP after the attack. The user character's AP is doubled after each attack but the enemy character's AP stays the same. Once an enemy character is defeated the user must choose another enemy to fight and cannot attack anything until an enemy is selected. When the user defeats all enemy characters then they have won the game. The user can restart the game and choose another character to fight with.
